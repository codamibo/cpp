In 1942, an Indian forest ranger discovered a remote lake,
high in the Himalayas, with something strange visible in its clear water.
The lake was full of human skeletons.
Since its discovery, the now infamous Lake Roopkund has attracted huge intrigue
over who the roughly 500 skeletons once were, and how they all came to rest there.
Like all great murder mysteries, the more people have investigated the deeper and
stranger this mystery has become.
